## Score

Increases with time. 
Once the score hits certain amounts the speed of the game will increase even more leading to higher scores.
Higher scores also increase the frequency of the enemies.

## Lives

Players will start with 3 lives. If one of the obstacles comes in contact with the character (as detailed above) it will lose a life. If Zapu however hits a green egg it will gain a life.
